# CIS-6370-Research-Ppaers
This repository includes two research works: SLIF, a framework integrating AI-driven threat modeling and DAST into SDLC to reduce vulnerabilities and enhance efficiency; and a study extending virtue ethics to AI-based social engineering, addressing ethical concerns like accountability, harm, and moderation in automated attacks.


# Secure Software Development using SLIF Framework

This academic research explores the Secure Lifecycle Integration Framework (SLIF), a comprehensive model for integrating security throughout the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC). The framework incorporates predictive analytics, dynamic testing (DAST), and secure UML annotations to proactively address vulnerabilities from the requirements phase to deployment.

Key highlights:
- Developed to align with Agile and DevOps practices
- Demonstrated 30% reduction in vulnerabilities and 15% improvement in time-to-market
- Includes case studies from healthcare, finance, and cloud technology sectors

The project was completed as part of the graduate-level course CIS 6370: Computer Data Security at Florida Atlantic University.

# Ethics of Social Engineering in Penetration Testing

This research paper investigates the ethical implications of using traditional and AI-driven social engineering (ASE) in penetration testing. Building on Joseph M. Hatfieldâ€™s virtue ethics model, it proposes an expanded ethical framework to evaluate automated manipulation tactics powered by AI.

Core contributions:
- Comparative ethical analysis: human-driven vs. AI-driven social engineering
- Application of virtue ethics principles: moderation, responsibility, and community good
- Practical recommendations for ethical oversight and AI governance in cybersecurity

Conducted as part of CIS 6370: Computer Data Security at Florida Atlantic University.
