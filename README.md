# CIS-6370-Research-Papers
This repository includes two research works: SLIF, a framework integrating AI-driven threat modeling and DAST into SDLC to reduce vulnerabilities and enhance efficiency; and a study extending virtue ethics to AI-based social engineering, addressing ethical concerns like accountability, harm, and moderation in automated attacks.


Secure Software Development Across SDLC Using Threat Modeling
CIS 6370 – Computer Data Security | Florida Atlantic University | Final Research Project | Dec 2024

Conducted an in-depth academic study on improving software security by embedding proactive security techniques into all stages of the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC).
Proposed the Secure Lifecycle Integration Framework (SLIF) to address limitations of traditional reactive security models by integrating threat modeling, UML annotations, and predictive analytics.
Analyzed real-world industry scenarios in healthcare, finance, and cloud services to demonstrate the framework’s theoretical potential in reducing vulnerabilities, development costs, and release delays.
Presented findings as a formal academic paper fulfilling final course requirements.





Ethical Implications of AI in Social Engineering Penetration Testing
CIS 6370 – Computer Data Security | Florida Atlantic University | Final Research Project | Dec 2024

Researched the growing ethical concerns of AI-powered automated social engineering (ASE) in cybersecurity contexts.
Applied and extended virtue ethics theory to evaluate the moral considerations of using automation in penetration testing scenarios.
Compared traditional human-led social engineering to automated campaigns, highlighting gaps in accountability, autonomy, and harm mitigation.
Proposed a hybrid ethical model combining AI ethics principles with virtue ethics to guide responsible use in cybersecurity testing environments.
